## Customization

### HTML

The HTML structure was organized for readability and accessibility. The content and structure in the `index.html` file can be updated as needed.

### CSS

Styles were defined in the `style.css` file. The appearance of the chatbot can be customized by modifying the CSS classes and properties.

### JavaScript

The main functionality was implemented in the `script.js` file. The JavaScript code can be extended or modified to add new features or change the behavior of the chatbot.

## API Integration

To integrate with the API:

1. Obtain your API key from the service provider.
2. Update the `API_KEY` variable in the `script.js` file with your API key:
    ```javascript
    const API_KEY = "your-api-key-here";
    ```
3. The chatbot will then use the specified API to generate responses.

## Get Your API Key

To obtain your API key for integrating the chatbot with Googleâ€™s Gemini API:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Navigate to the API key section and create a new API key.

**Note:** The API is free but has a limited number of usage requests.
